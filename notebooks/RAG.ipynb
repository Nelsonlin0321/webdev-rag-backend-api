But those limits leave a large variety to choose from. In the previous chapter, \\nI wrote about how to identify and scope AI projects. This chapter and the next have a slightly \\ndifferent emphasis: picking and executing projects with an eye toward career development.\\nA fruitful career will include many projects, hopefully growing in scope, complexity, and impact \\nover time. Thus, it is fine to start small. Use early projects to learn and gradually step up to \\nbigger projects as your skills grow.\\nWhen you’re starting out, don’t expect others to hand great ideas or resources to you on a platter. \\nMany people start by working on small projects in their spare time. With initial successes — even \\nsmall ones — under your belt, your growing skills increase your ability to come up with better \\nideas, and it becomes easier to persuade others to help you step up to bigger projects.Finding Projects that Compliment Your Career Goals CHAPTER 5\\nJoin existing projects. If you find someone else with an idea, ask to join their project.\\nKeep reading and talking to people. I come up with new ideas whenever I spend a lot of \\ntime reading, taking courses, or talking with domain experts. I’m confident that you will, too.\\nFocus on an application area. Many researchers are trying to advance basic AI technology \\n— say, by inventing the next generation of transformers or further scaling up language \\nmodels — so, while this is an exciting direction, it is also very hard. But the variety of \\napplications to which machine learning has not yet been applied is vast! I’m fortunate to \\nhave been able to apply neural networks to everything from autonomous helicopter flight to \\nonline advertising, partly because I jumped in when relatively few people were working on \\nthose applications. If your company or school cares about a particular application, explore \\nthe possibilities for machine learning.
